* Description
This file is dedicated to my current and WIP projects.

* [[https://github.com/Superfly-Johnson/Configurations][Portable configurations]]
I'd like my configurations to work on any system I have following simple executing a little ./install.sh script, or the equivalent on windows. Still WIP, but I'm getting there. 
Currently I have a Nix configuration and my emacs configuration finalized.

** .bashrc
I want a portable .bashrc that would work roughly the same on any Unix system.
** SSH integration with keepassxc's automatic configuration
A SystemD unit file and a little script to configure KeepassXC's dotfile to properly find the right paths to the sockets would be extremely nice.

* Containers
** Nix-based OpenLPAD server container
This could be used to integrate with KDE's Kontact suite while on linux systems. 
** Nix-based Sieve server container
This would be extremely useful as it'd integrate both with Claws Mail and Kmail's filtering system, and it could be used to showcase the usefulness of mail filtering languages.

* Websites
** Cloud-storage comparison website
A little website made with Django that would compare pricing for various websites. This requires a web scraper, a SQL backend and possibly a container to be made later, where the project would be downloaded as a submodule.
